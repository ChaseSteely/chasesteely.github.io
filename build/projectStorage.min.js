After an excellent planning phase, we settled on a company name - FairyBnB - and what services our company would provide - tours to mythical lands. Our group, the Distracted Llamas, went to the whiteboard to lay out our vision for the site. Each of us was responsible for creating a database, using JSON.stringify() and localStorage.setItem() to store the data in local storage. We would control and display our databases through JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem()), looping through our data, and writing all the HTML with innerHTML +=. I was responsible for the Packages and Souvenirs page.","10/18/2017","Chase Steely - Jenna Solis - Jason Figueroa - Kimme Bird","fairybnb.chasesteely.com","HTML"," CSS"," Javascript"),firstSprint=projectObjectFactory("b√¶kur","<img src='../img/book.jpg' alt=''>","Our first sprint of Nashville Software School Cohort 22 was to build a company website using Javascript to populate our HTML, utilizing a database we created that we stored in local storage.
