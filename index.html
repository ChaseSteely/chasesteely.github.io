                <p class="center"><em>Student at Nashville Software School. Full-Stack Software Developer.</em></p>
                <p class="about">I am an Army veteran from Nashville, TN pursuing a career as a Junior Developer. I am a recent graduate of Trident Technical College in Charleston, SC, 
                    where I majored in Computer Programming. My degree track provided opportunities to learn skills in a variety of programming languages such as JavaScript, 
                    Java, C#, JQuery, CSS, HTML5, and SQL. From October 2017 - March 2018, I will be enrolled in Nashville Software School's Web Developer Bootcamp, C# and .NET track. 
                    When I'm not in school or sharpening my coding skills, you will find me spending time with my awesome wife, reading, listening to podcasts, 
                    enjoying live-music downtown, cheering on the Predators, Vols, and Titans, or dusting the camera off to shoot photos.</p>
                <p class="center"><strong>Here is what I am learning at Nashville Software School</strong></p>
                <p class="nss">The Web Developer Bootcamp is a six-month, full-time program. The curriculum teaches the skills and technologies required to become a full-stack software developer.
